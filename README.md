College Event Reminder System

Problem Statement:

Event details are usually shared through notice boards, messages, or word of mouth, which can be easily overlooked.

Hence, a digital solution is required to organize college events and notify users on time.

To provide timely reminders for upcoming events.
       To reduce manual effort in tracking college activities.
       To improve student participation and punctuality.
       To create a simple and user-friendly application using Python.

       Programming Language: Python
       Graphical User Interface: Tkinter
       Database: SQLite
       Libraries: datetime, threading, tkinter, sqlite3
       Platform: Desktop Application
