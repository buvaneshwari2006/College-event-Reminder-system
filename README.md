College Event Reminder System

Problem Statement:

         In colleges, students and staff often miss important academic and extracurricular events due to lack of proper communication and reminders. Event details are usually shared through notice boards, messages, or word of mouth, which can be easily overlooked. There is no centralized system to manage events and send timely reminders, leading to poor participation and missed deadlines. Hence, a digital solution is required to organize college events and notify users on time.

Objectives:

       To design a system that stores and manages college event details efficiently.
To provide timely reminders for upcoming events.
       To reduce manual effort in tracking college activities.
       To improve student participation and punctuality.
       To create a simple and user-friendly application using Python.

Technologies Used:

       Programming Language: Python
       Graphical User Interface: Tkinter
       Database: SQLite
       Libraries: datetime, threading, tkinter, sqlite3
       Platform: Desktop Application
